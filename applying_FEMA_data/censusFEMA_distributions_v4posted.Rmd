This is test script for pulling Median Income for one US state
```{r}

in_state <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"),

Consumer price index file downloaded from:
https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm
```{r}
cpi <- read.csv(file = 'cpi_2.csv')

Average the index values across the months for a given year
```{r}
cpi79 = cpi$AVG[cpi$Year==1979]
cpi89 = cpi$AVG[cpi$Year==1989]

cpi10 = cpi$AVG[cpi$Year==2010]

Use tidycensus to pull county level data for 2020 and 2010 Median Income
```{r}

med_income_counties_20 <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"), 
              year = 2020)

med_income_counties_20

med_income_counties_10 <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"), 
              year = 2010)

med_income_counties_10

```

Pull county data to link census data with other county files
To download and use the Tiger Shapefiles shared by the US Census Bureau we will use the tigris package. Set cb = TRUE to get generalized files, these donâ€™t have high resolution details and hence are smaller in size.

Pulling FEMA disaster declarations from OpenFema site

# Paging example in R. Receiving data in JSON, saving in RDS - a single R object.

require("httr")         # wrapper for curl package - may require installation

# This is a simple JSON parser library (may require installation), but since we are not 
#   really doing JSON manipulation to get the data, this is not needed.

Obtaining the FIPS code (last three digits) and county_code_flag (first two digits) from the placeCode field
```{r}
#library(stringi)
fullData$fips <- with(fullData,stri_sub(fullData$placeCode,-3))
fullData$county_flag <- with(fullData,substr(fullData$placeCode, 1, 2) )
```

Only include the rows that are counties (county_flag = 99)
```{r}
co_FullData <- fullData %>% filter(fullData$county_flag=='99')
```

Create two sets of 20-year disaster declarations
```{r}
class(co_FullData$fyDeclared) = "Numeric"
femadd_75to95 <- co_FullData %>% filter(co_FullData$fyDeclared > 1974 & co_FullData$fyDeclared <1996)
femadd_96to16 <- co_FullData %>% filter(co_FullData$fyDeclared > 1995 & co_FullData$fyDeclared <2017)

class(co_FullData$fyDeclared) = "Numeric"
femadd_79to99 <- co_FullData %>% filter(co_FullData$fyDeclared > 1978 & co_FullData$fyDeclared <2000)
femadd_00to20 <- co_FullData %>% filter(co_FullData$fyDeclared > 1999 & co_FullData$fyDeclared <2021)
 

```

Tally (count) by state and county FIPS code the number of entries
```{r}
tally_byFIPS <- co_FullData %>% group_by(co_FullData$state, co_FullData$fips) %>% tally()
tally_byFIPS <- rename(tally_byFIPS, FEMA_DD_count = n)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
